Prompt used to make this web page

“Make me a simple, modern webpage using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
It should have:

A clean navbar with a logo on the left and some links on the right.

A hero section with a big background image, a bold heading in the center, and a short subheading below.

A content section below the hero, laid out in a grid with 4 cards (2 per row) — each card should have a title, description, and a subtle shadow.

A minimal footer with some links and copyright text.

Keep it responsive, neat, and easy to read.”
